# CONDITIONAL-RENDERING-AND-EVENT-HANDLING-IN-REACT
In React, conditional rendering is the process of displaying different content based on certain conditions or states. It allows you to create dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to changes in data and user interactions. In this process, you can use conditional statements to decide what content should be rendered.
